    <h2>A Polish Classic: Kotlet Schabowy</h2>
    <p>
      My partner is an amazing cook. Every other day, I find myself being fed something new, something unexpected, and always something delicious. I’m constantly amazed. Not just by the food itself, but by taste of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months ago, he told me about <em>kotlet schabowy</em>. I was already excited — anything involving comfort food gets my full attention. When dinner came, he served it alongside vinegar beetroot (from a jar, no shame here) and a generous helping of mashed potatoes. Gosh, I love potatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what I witnessed in the kitchen, the schabowy starts with thin pork cutlets, which he pounded until they were nearly see-through. Then came salt and pepper, a dip in flour, followed by beaten egg, and finally a generous coat of breadcrumbs. Into the hot oil they went, sizzling away until golden and crisp.
    </p>
    <p>
      It smelled heavenly. It also looked like a flour bomb had gone off. The counter was covered in breadcrumbs, the floor had egg splatters, and somehow the fridge door had a bit of flour on it too. We have a very simple agreement in our home: if one of us cooks, the other does the dishes. And I knew I was in for lots of flour wiping.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the mashed potatoes — my contribution. He asked for them simple, because apparently I make “the best mashed potatoes.” (I’m going to pretend that’s an official title.) Just four ingredients: butter, salt, pepper, and a splash of <em>śmietanka</em>. Basically, a recipe for high cholesterol and extreme comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beetroot was straight from the jar, vinegary and cold, the perfect bite to cut through the richness of everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautifully simple meal. Golden pork, creamy mash, tangy beetroot. I was, once again, amazed — not just by the taste, but by the tiny ritual of cooking and sharing something made with love. Even if it meant scrubbing oil off the stovetop afterwards.
